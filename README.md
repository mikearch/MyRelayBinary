# MyRelayBinary
This project is my first libary creation in the Arduino IDE.
Its purpose is to enable the management of multiple relays
by facilitating pin assignment and easy handling of normally open and normally closed wirings

Wiring of relays with power to the Common will be handled in a separate libary
